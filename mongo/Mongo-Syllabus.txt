MongoD Tools Overview
MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Compass, and the Mongo Shell.


MongoDB Atlas 
is a platform that provides an interface to manage and deploy MongoDB across cloud providers and regions.
It was built to launch and manage your deployments for you, which simplifies the operational overhead of running a deployment.
This type of offering is called database as a service. What that means is that Atlas helps you easily setup and manage your database from your Atlas account on the web.
There are multiple tiers of Atlas subscriptions. Also it supports free tier subscription to set up a database, view and modify data.
The free tier allows you to experiment with the platform at no cost to you.


Compass.
Compass provides a graphical user interface that allows you to explore the data in your database.
It is a great tool to get a quick view of the shape and state of your data, as well as test out MongoDB features 
as you are learning about the database and its functionality.
You can use Compass to optimize query performance and manage indexes, among other things.


Mongo Shell
which is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB.
The Mongo Shell is great for playing around with all the features that the database has to offer, 
and really learning about MongoDB query language and functionality.
